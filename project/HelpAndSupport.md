## How to ask for help

* Submit only one request per report.
* State your platform, operating system and version.
* State the version of {{ site.software_name }} you are using:
  - If you are using a source code release then give the version
    number of that release. 
  - If you are using a binary release then you can get the version
    number by running:

~~~
$ ./TODO-SOFTWARE-NAME --version
~~~

  - If you are using a binary release then the version number can be
    seen using the Help => About menu option.
  - If you are using a version from Subversion then give the 
    revision you are using:

~~~
$ svn info
~~~

  - If you are using a version from Git then give the commit hash
    of the version you are using:

~~~
$ git log -1
~~~

* Provide any error messages and exceptions that you see. 
  - If providing exceptions then provide these exactly as displayed in
    a terminal window. 
  - Do **not** provide a simple textual summary like 'It threw an
    error'. 
  - If using a graphical user interface, then see the next point.
* If using any graphical user interface and, if you think
  it would help, then send a copy of your display: 
  - Under Ubuntu, use the Print Screen key to save an image of your
    display into your home directory as a .png file. 
  - Under Windows, click CTRL and Print Screen, select Start =>
    All Programs => Accessories => Paint, click CTRL and V to 
    paste the image into Paint and then Save the image as a .png
    or .jpg file.
* If possible, provide a recipe for repeating the bug.
* Provide any other information you think will help.
* Clearly separate fact from speculation.

Requests of the form "I used {{ site.software_name }} and am stuck" are
not helpful to either you or us and people may suspect that you are
just a spammer or time waster.

No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs.
