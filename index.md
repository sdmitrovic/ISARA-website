title: In Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (ISARA)
home: true
---

{{ site.software_name }} is an open-source Python codebase that models ambient aerosol optical and microphysical properties using user-inputted field
campaign instrument data sets. This software calculates these properties separately for fine-mode and coarse-mode particles at the wavelength(s) and
relative humidity (RH) level(s) of choice. {{ site.software_name }} also has the capability to handle spheroids and other irregularly-shaped particles.
These features enable comprehensive evaluations of incredibly complex and diverse sets of aerosol particle profiles encountered within field campaigns.
We hope that the community uses this software to streamline verification of field aerosol data sets and ultimately advance field campaign data quality
assurance. More information on this software including installation and use can be found in "User Guide". Click here to access application
